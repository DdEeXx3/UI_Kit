## Installation

Getting started with UI Kit is pretty easy! All you need to do is include our CSS file link to your HTML project. 
After that, you can use our tool immediately.

```html
<body>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://ddeexx3.github.io/UI_Kit/ui_kit.css">
...
</body>
```

REMEMBER! All your CSS files should be included in HTML after our CSS!

## That's it!

UI Kit is now ready to use! :D

## Get to know how it works

Everything you can do with our tool is operated by proper use of classes. Some of the elements are set by default. Get to know how to use them in next pages.
