## Before you start

Welcome in our Classes Dictionary! In this place you may find any of our UI Kit class, you can use on your page.

We created it for you to have condensed knowledge in one place. If you forget any name of our class you can have a glance to get to know it. We also summarised mean of usage for every class. 

## Important note

Remember! This section is not a tutorial of our Kit. If you want to learn how to use our classes and see examples, you should see __Getting Started__ section first!
